# PHP jQuery Validation plugin class #
This PHP class complements the [jQuery Validation plugin](http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/) to provide server-side form validation with the same rules used in the jQuery Validation Plugin for the client-side.

The goal of the class is to have a single place where all form validation is handled, with uniform error messages and presentation.
